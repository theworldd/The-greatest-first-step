    <h2>Lunch</h2>
    Lunch, an abbreviation for luncheon, is a meal eaten around midday.[1] During the 20th century, the meaning gradually narrowed to a small or mid-sized meal eaten midday. Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day, after breakfast. The meal varies in size depending on the culture, and significant variations exist in different areas of the world.
